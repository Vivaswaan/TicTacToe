# TicTacToe
The file tictactoe.py contains teh simple implementation of the popular TicTacToe game that can be played by 2 players taking chances alternatively.
The other file tictactoe_ai_minimax.py has the same game but for a single player where the other player turns are done by using the minimax ai algorithm. In that game the ai never loses i.e the best outcome for player will be a draw otherwise the ai wins.
